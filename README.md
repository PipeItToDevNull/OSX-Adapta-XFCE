# OSX-Adapta-XFCE
An OSXish XFCE theme based on Adapta and OSX-Arc

This theme uses components from both [Adapta](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme) and [OSX-Arc](https://github.com/LinxGem33/OSX-Arc-White) both projects licensed under GPLv2. 

This repo only contains modified XFWM4 images from OSX-Arc that have been adapted to the colours of Adapta. You will need to obtain the rest of the Adapta theme from the orginal developer.
